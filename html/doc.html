                    <b>Tech Africa cohort 2.0 2022</b> , is a six weeks training program
                    where trainees are trained in different tech skills including
                    frontend web devlopment. The frontend web development covers
                    frontend languages like HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT. At the end
                    of the training, students under web development were partitioned
                    into different groups and group project were assigned accordingly.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    However, members of group 24 were assigned the project topic of
                    building a calendar. The project which is expected to be build based
                    on the training experience received so far. Though, there is no
                    specific description on how the calendar will look like and the
                    functionalities that will be attached to it. After our research,
                    we (group 24 members) were able to accomplish our task. The project
                    was carried out with HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT as follows: <br><br>
                    <strong><u>HTML: </u></strong> We used HTML to build, and structure
                    our project pages by making use of the proper HTML semantics.
                    Each of our two pages is made up of header, main and footer. <br>

                    <strong><u>CSS: </u></strong>In this project, we used CSS to beautify
                    our web pages. This was achieved by linking the external style sheet
                    properly in the head tag of the pages. The colors, font-size, and every
                    other thing that makes our work to look good were as a result of CSS. <br>

                    <strong><u>JAVASCRIPT: </u></strong>Apart from using HTML and CSS above
                    to put the words and the styles, Javascript is the language that made the
                    calendar to give a dynamic output. Ranging from, the Javascript inbuilt
                    functions to numerous function created to enable us achieve what we want. <br><br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is worthy of note that the primary function surrounding this project
                    is the Javascript Date function. The function was tweaked in different
                    ways to output what we have as a calendar. <br>
                    <strong>The Calendar</strong> itself is divided into 2 major parts.
                    Its upper part has a box with a background image. Within the box is
                    the current day of the week, current date, month and the year.
                    On the right hand side is a two arrow keys that enables you to scroll
                    to the previous and next month of any year. The down part shows the
                    calendar proper. In this box you will see, the week days(sunday-saturday),
                    date of the month, 1-31 as the case may be. The dates in red and yellow
                    colors(for tablet and mobile phones) are inactive for that particular month.

                    One date that is different with its background-color being blue
                    (tablet and mobile phones) and violet is the current date for a particular
                    day. <br><br>

                    With the help of CSS media query, we were able to make our work mobile responsive across
                    all devices. Meaning that it can appear and fit well in all devices be it desktop,
                    laptop, tablet and mobile phones.

                    <b>Reference:</b> As trainees who are curious about learning and developing
                    ourselves, in addition to our lecture video tutorial guides. We visited
                    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com" target="_blank">W3schools.com</a> and watched some
                    youtube videos, all this helped us alot to accomplish this task.
